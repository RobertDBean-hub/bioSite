She plans to pursue a professional writing career, with aspirations to publish her first book by the end of 2025.</p>
        <h3>Singing and Dancing</h3>
        <p>Music was a part of life in Yves's household. She began singing in plays and pageants since she was six years old and has fond memories of dancing to music played by her parents. She incorporates dancing into her daily exercise routine and continues to sing whenever she can.</p>
        <h3>Composing Music</h3>
        <p>Yves's parents, who were musically inclined, played a significant role in her musical development. Her father taught her to appreciate music on a deeper level, and her mother's educational rap inspired her to explore writing and composing music. Yves enjoys composing music and believes it is a way to connect with her family and herself.</p>
